# Learning javascript by building 7 games

I see the article at  [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-javascript-by-building-7-games-video-course/), where the developer, lady Ania Kubow offers a javascript course by building games such as: Memory game, Whack-a-ole, Connect four, Snanke, Space Invaders, Frogger and Tetris.

The javascript methods that cover these games are: 
```javascript
querySelector()
addEventListener()
classList.remove()
Array.from()
getElementsByClassName()
appendChild()
...
```

In this repository, I try to divide the result by folders and I try to comment all the parts that I considered relevant.

## Installation

You just clone the project and that's it. Each folder has its index.html file where you can open on a browser and see the result.
