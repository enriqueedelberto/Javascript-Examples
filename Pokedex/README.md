# Learning javascript by building 7 games

I see the article at  [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-practical-guide-to-typescript-how-to-build-a-pokedex-app-using-html-css-and-typescript/), where the developer,  Ibrahima Ndaw shows how to create a basic App using HTML, Css and Typescript.

: 
```typescript
 
...
```

In this repository, I try to do what he shows, but I add some elements from my own.

## Installation

You just clone the project and that's it. Each folder has its index.html file where you can open on a browser and see the result.

If you want to modify something and add your own elements, you should install the following:
 Install Node.js
 Install typescript from your terminal(windows or mac or linux)
